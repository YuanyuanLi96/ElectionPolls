# ElectionPolls

This is the R code package for paper "Post-election Analysis of Presidential Election/Poll Data".

For analysis in section 1-3 and supplement: run "preprocessing.R" to get "long_dat.csv" under data folder, then run "sme.R".

For analysis in section 4: run "preprocessing_byweek.R" to get "long_dat_5w.csv" under data folder, then replace "long_dat.csv" by "long_dat_5w.csv" in "sme.R", and rerun the file.
